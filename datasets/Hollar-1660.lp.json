Contributors were either recruited from established groups within the community or chosen from responses to appeals broadcast over the radio: 56% of the interviewees were male and 44% female, ranging from five to 107 years old and drawn from a diversity of ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds. From the outset, the project sought to focus on local, everyday experiences and interviewees were encouraged to reflect on events and change at a community level rather than on the wider world stage.",

From 1950 to 1961 a team of fieldworkers collected data in a network of 313 localities across England, initially in the form of transcribed responses to a questionnaire containing over 1300 items. The informants were mostly farm labourers, predominantly male and generally over 65 years old as the aim of the survey was to capture the most conservative forms of folk-speech. Almost all the sites visited by the researchers were rural locations, as it was felt that traditional dialect was best preserved in isolated areas. It was initially the intention to include urban areas at a later date, but this plan had to be abandoned on economic grounds.",

From 1950 to 1961 a team of fieldworkers collected data in a network of 313 localities across England, initially in the form of transcribed responses to a questionnaire containing over 1300 items. The informants were mostly farm labourers, predominantly male and generally over 65 years old as the aim of the survey was to capture the most conservative forms of folk-speech. Almost all the sites visited by the researchers were rural locations, as it was felt that traditional dialect was best preserved in isolated areas. It was initially the intention to include urban areas at a later date, but this plan had to be abandoned on economic grounds.",

Bequeathed to the nation by Sir John Cotton (d. 1702), entering the collections of the British Museum in 1753, incorporated as the British Library in 1973. (See the catalogue of Cotton manuscripts: Add MS 36682). f. i: early modern parchment pastedown (lifted). f. i recto: erased Cottonian binding instructions (upper margin). f. i verso: pressmarks 'Faustina B. 9.' in the hand of William Dugdale (d. 1686), 'XV A' & 'XVI B'; early modern memoranda (upper margin) referring to popes & emperors, and to Nicholas Trevet (d. in or after 1334) (lower left-hand corner parallel to outer margin). f. 1: early modern parchment endleaf. f. 1r: Cottonian list of contents (4 items) in the hand of Richard James (d. 1638), with §§1-2 corrected in a later hand; f. 1v blank.

                        "collection": "Western Manuscripts",
                        "description": "1 volume. An important witness to the amateur interest in and practice of pharmaceutical medicine by King Henry VIII (b. 1491, d. 1547). Contains a collection of more than 100 medical recipes that have been organised into six sections: plasters; spasmadraps (dipped plasters); ointments; balms; waters, lotions, and decoctions; and cataplasms (poultices). As a number of the recipes indicate, the collection was designed for Henry VIII. This is also suggested by the fact that many recipes provide treatments for easing pain and swelling and cooling inflammation in the legs, and healing leg ulcers, conditions from which Henry VIII suffered following jousting accidents in 1527 and 1536. Over 30 recipes are attributed to the king himself, including one that he apparently devised for Anne of Cleves ('my ladye Anne of Cleve'), queen consort from 6 January to 9 July 1540. Many of the other recipes are attributed to his four royal physicians: William Butts (b. c. 1486, d. 1545) and John Chambre (b. 1470, d. 1549), who are famously depicted with the king on Hans Holbein the Younger's painting Henry VIII and the Barber Surgeons, and Walter Cromer (d. c. 1547), and Augustin de Angustinius (n. d.), a Venetian who was also physician to Cardinal Wolsey. They apparently devised their medical treatments both separately from and collaboratively with one another. The collection suggests that Henry VIII and his physicians predominantly relied on a medieval tradition of herbal, lapidary and chemical remedies. They evidently also subscribed to the medicinal properties of what they believed to be unicorn horn (alicorn). Various recipes, e.g. the Rochestre plastre, Emplastrum de cornubus, Swete Oyntement, Russett Oyntement, Gray plaster, and Unguentum de cornubus, require the use of powdered 'cornu unicornu' or 'unicornis horne'. William Butts also had access to learned medical works since the Italian surgeon Giovanni da Vigo (b. 1450, d. 1525), who published his Practica Copiosa in Arte Chirurgia in 1514, and the Greek physician Galen (129–199) are cited as his sources. The collection mentions the locations where a number of recipes were devised and put into practice. Henry VIII worked on treatments at Ampthill, Cawood, Fotheringhay, Greenwich, Hampton Court, St James, and Westminster; and the royal physicians worked on theirs at Farnham Castle, Greenwich, St James, the Manor of the More at Ricksmansworth, and Westminster. A number of anonymous recipes are located to still other places: Canterbury, Dover, Knolles, Petworth, and Rochester. These references suggest that Henry VIII and his physicians brought their apothecary equipment with them to the various royal palaces and other residencies they visited. The collection's medical treatments may have been designed over a long period of time: probably between 1536, when Henry VIII's leg condition is thought to have significantly worsened, and 1545, when William Butts died. The fact that the collection is neatly organised into sections with their own tables of contents suggests that it was copied in a single and preplanned undertaking. The reference to Anne of Cleves provides a terminus post quem. This indicates that the manuscript was written between c. 1540 and c. 1545, perhaps for Henry VIII or one of his physicians.
